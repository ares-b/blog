Whenever we declare variable, object, call a method or perform operations on a JVM based language like Java or Scala, 
the JVM assigns memory to these operations from Heap Space or Stack Memory.

In this article, we dive into these two memory models and see which one is used on which use cases.

I'll provide you some example code in Scala to get things illustrated, but the same principles applies to Java or any
other JVM based language.
